# Bank Deposit Prediction - Kaggle Competition

## 🏦 Competition Overview

This repository contains my solution for the **Bank Deposit Prediction** Kaggle competition. The goal is to predict whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on various demographic, financial, and behavioral features.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Banks need to identify potential customers who are likely to subscribe to term deposits. This is a **binary classification problem** where we predict:
- **Target Variable**: Whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit (Yes/No)
- **Business Value**: Helps banks optimize their marketing campaigns and improve conversion rates

## 📊 Dataset Features

The dataset typically includes features such as:
- **Demographic Information**: Age, job, marital status, education
- **Financial Data**: Balance, housing loan, personal loan
- **Contact Information**: Contact type, month, day of week
- **Campaign Details**: Number of contacts, previous campaign outcomes
- **Social/Economic Context**: Employment variation rate, consumer price index
